# Waiting in the Queue

I should have known that there would be a huge crowd at the registration desks of the {{site.tagung}}. So what does a writer do? A madangbal type of a writer such as myself whips out a smart phone and starts chattering to people online^^ While I was socializing with friends and family, the queue decreased quickly in size and I got to my workshop almost in time.
