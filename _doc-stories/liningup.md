# Waiting in the Queue

I should have known that there would be a huge crowd at the registration desks of the {{site.tagung}}. So what does a writer do? A madangbal type of a writer such as myself whips out a smart phone and starts chattering to people online^^ While I was socializing with friends and family, the queue decreased quickly in size and I got to my workshop almost in time.

So this is an attempt to use a prefabricated text component:

{%include intro var='Erwartung' %}

Written by {{page.author}}
on {{page.edit}} including text components written by the lovely parson-AG team
